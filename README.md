The detection algorithm will take in the data from the sensor fusion in
order to accurately detect an explosive. The team plans to use low-level sensor fusion to be the
most accurate in detection. Low-level fusion combines data from the sensors before any
decision-making process is applied to the data. The sensor fusion and detection algorithms will
have to be efficient to allow for real-time detection of explosives.
